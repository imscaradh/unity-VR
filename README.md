# Unity VR: Simple Patrolling Game

This repository contains the sources for the Advanced Game Development Course of the University of Applied Science Bern. The main plot of the game is simple: A red agent is patrolling on a lost planet and searches for human beings. If there is an activity within it's view angle, the agent starts chasing. You as the player have only one chance, flee!

## Installation / Deployment
This project requires the following stuff:
* Unity Version 5.5
* Android SDK Tools rev. 25.2.2
* Google Cardboard

To install it, simply change the build platform to "Android" under "Build settings". This will generates you the apk which you can deploy on your Smartphone.

## Troubleshooting
I experienced problems with Unity and SDK tools newer than rev. 25.2.2 on Linux.
